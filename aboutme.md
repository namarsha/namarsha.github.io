title: Qualitative Quantitative Analyst
subtitle: 
---

Qual/Quant Data Analysis is my invented term to describe the unique skillset I've developed. Some people are word people. Some people are number people. I aspire to be both, because the flows of useful data are made up of both. I aim to combine the best of the humanities with a passion for statistical and computational methods for problem solving. In short: I'm as comfortable with Heidegger as I am with a spreadsheet.  	
         
My passions lie at the intersection of two worlds. I am interested in the beliefs and practices of humans of all times and places, and I'm developing an expertise in utilizing the latest technologies to derive actionable insights. I hold a PhD in the study of religion (read: the study of ultimate meaning), and I'm earning an MS in Data Science (the practical tools needed to identify and solve fundamental problems.)
               
I'm currently seeking opportunities to combine the rigorous, statistics-driven methods of an analyst with the insight and critical questioning of a classically trained philosopher.
